# LAS 101 Project — GitHub Pages

This folder is ready for **GitHub Pages**.

## Quick Deploy (new repo)
1. Create a repo on GitHub (e.g., `las-101-project`). **Do NOT** add any starter files.
2. Download this folder (or the ZIP) and upload its files to the repo root.
3. In the repo: Settings → **Pages** → Source = `Deploy from a branch`, Branch = `main` (/**root**).
4. Wait ~1–2 minutes. Your site will be at `https://<your-username>.github.io/<repo-name>/`.

## Update later
Edit `index.html` and push. Pages redeploys automatically.
